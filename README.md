# Procrastination Tax - DeFi Protocol

## Project Description

The Procrastination Tax Protocol is an innovative DeFi mechanism that encourages timely decision-making by implementing an escalating tax system on delayed transactions. Users schedule transactions with the protocol, and if they delay execution, they pay an increasing tax that grows exponentially over time. This creates a powerful economic incentive for prompt action while generating revenue for the protocol.

The protocol operates on a simple yet effective principle: the cost of indecision increases with time. Users deposit funds to schedule transactions (withdrawals, swaps, stakes, etc.), and the longer they wait to execute these transactions, the higher the tax becomes. This mechanism can be integrated into various DeFi applications to reduce analysis paralysis and encourage active participation.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a behavioral economics-driven DeFi ecosystem that promotes decisive action and reduces the inefficiencies caused by procrastination in financial decision-making. By gamifying the cost of delay, we aim to:

- **Reduce Decision Paralysis**: Encourage users to make timely financial decisions
- **Improve Capital Efficiency**: Prevent funds from sitting idle due to indecision  
- **Create Sustainable Revenue**: Generate protocol revenue through procrastination taxes
- **Promote Active Engagement**: Incentivize regular interaction with DeFi protocols
- **Behavioral Improvement**: Help users develop better financial decision-making habits

The ultimate goal is to integrate this mechanism across various DeFi protocols, creating a more efficient and psychologically-aware decentralized financial ecosystem.

## Key Features

### üïê **Time-Based Tax Calculation**
- Exponential tax growth formula: `base_rate * days^1.5`
- Starting rate of 1% per day with a maximum cap of 50%
- Same-day execution incurs zero tax, encouraging immediate action

### üí∞ **Flexible Transaction Scheduling**
- Schedule any type of transaction (swaps, staking, etc.)
- Deposit ETH to secure your intended transaction amount
- Unique transaction IDs for tracking and execution

### üìä **Transparent Tax Tracking**
- Real-time tax calculation for pending transactions
- Complete transaction history for each user
- Public visibility of accumulated protocol revenue

### üîí **Security & Access Control**
- ReentrancyGuard protection against attacks
- User authorization for transaction execution
- Ownable pattern for protocol governance

### üí∏ **Efficient Fund Management**
- Automatic excess ETH handling
- User balance withdrawal functionality
- Protocol tax collection mechanism

### üìà **Advanced Analytics**
- Individual transaction details and status
